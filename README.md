# ticketchecker
A ticketing system made in only 2 hours for New Year's Eve in a housing society. Generated qr codes on tickets. Developed a website to scan qr codes with audio validation - "Valid" or "Invalid". This automated the manual plate counting process and made the event a little technology influenced.
